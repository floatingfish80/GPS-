Performance Analysis of AI driven GPS spoofing and Mitigation techniques.
Working on the design and analysis of a GPS signal spoofing and detection system enhanced by
AI/MLtechniques. Aims todevelop anti-spoofing algorithms, simulate GPS signals, and evaluate
performance underrealistic threat scenarios.
Work is still under progress... Will be updated soon
